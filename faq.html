    		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    				
    		<ul>
        		<li class="question">Will food be provided during the week?</li>
                <p class="answer">
                    Lunch and dinner will be provided for most of the days (not all). We will be accommodating dietary restrictions (i.e. halal, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and nut-free). We recommend bringing snacks and non-alcoholic drinks throughout the day to keep you going if needed.
                </p>
                
                <li class="question">Will there be on-campus living accommodations for commuter students?</li>
                <p class="answer">
                    Unfortunately, for the safety of our students we will not provide residence accommodations for commuter students.
                </p>
                
                <li class="question">What happens if I’m late?</li>
                <p class="answer">
                    There is no penalty for being late than missing out on our great programming. To avoid confusion and loss of direction, we prefer all students to be on time for the Orientation as events will happen right from the get go. 
                </p>
                
                <li class="question">Will there be alcohol at Orientation?</li> 
                <p class="answer">
                    New College Orientation will NOT have any alcohol surrounding events, to ensure that all our students are being safe and to avoid any issues. 
                </p>
                
                <li class="question">Can I bring a friend?</li> 
                <p class="answer">
                    Only those who are New College students who have registered and paid for Orientation will be able to attend our Orientation events. A wristband policy will be in effect. 
                </p>
                
                <li class="question">What is the difference between New College Orientation and Ignite?</li> 
                <p class="answer">
                    New College Orientation includes both social- and academic- based activities as IGNITE! is an academic focused orientation. IGNITE! will be limited to 120 students and will take place on Saturday, September 9<sup>th</sup>. Students are welcome to take part in both Orientations; however, you will have to complete both registration forms.
                </p>
                
                <li class="question">Do I have to wear New College shirts throughout Orientation?</li> 
                <p class="answer">
                    We strongly encourage all registered students to wear the 2017 Orientation t-shirts that we will be providing in the Orientation Kits. With that being said, your wristband is what is required for entry for majority of Orientation events. 
                </p>
                
                <li class="question">Will there be phone chargers provided?</li> 
                <p class="answer">
                    New College does have charging stations throughout the premises, so you will be able to charge your phones. However, New College is not responsible for the items left at charging stations so make sure you keep an eye when charging your phone!
                </p>
                
                <li class="question">Where do I register?</li> 
                <p class="answer">
                    Registration can be done here: <a href="https://campustix.com/tix/352e0d2d/">Register for New College Orientation</a><br>
                    
                    Students are able to register until September 3<sup>rd</sup> online. Late registrations will still be accepted in person starting September 4<sup>th</sup> during Orientation. Please note, full payment is required prior to participating in Orientation events.
                </p>
                
                <li class="question">I’ll be commuting from far away, will it be worth my time?</li>
                <p class="answer">
                    Of course! This is a great opportunity to find out what you can expect over the next 4 years of your university career. Not only will you be able to gain information about resources on campus, but also meet people that you will build long-lasting friendships with. 
                </p>
                
                <li class="question">Do I have to attend all the events?</li>
                <p class="answer">
                    Well… no, but we highly encourage you to try out all the events! There are different events for different people, and all are programs should benefit you in some way! 
                </p>
